    <h1>Bugbank</h1>
    <p>Bugbank is a collaboration with Public Health England and UK Biobank. The objective of bugbank is to facilitate infection disease research by dynamically integrating the UK Biobank and the PHE Microbiology databases. This would enable us to better understand the lifestyle, medical and genetic risks for common infections in a large cohort over time.

    <p>The phases of the bugbank project are
    <ol>
      <li>Improve the information about infection available to scientists studying the UK Biobank by incorporating data from PHE such as the specific type of infection and the effectiveness of drugs. This improves the chances of finding new risk factors and genes that increase the risk of infection.
      <li>Incorporate data from PHE into UK Biobank not just periodically, but every single day. Initially a prerequisite for phase 3, this system is being repurposed to study Covid-19 coronavirus pandemic. The initiative will help scientists discover whether genes or environment explain why some people suffer life-threatening infections.
      <li>Assess the practicality of collecting germs grown from UK Biobank participants in hospital microbiology labs. Growing the germs would allow scientists to learn more about them, how they cause infection, and whether differences in germ genes are important.
    </ol>
    The computer systems required for phase 1 and 2 objectives have been created and tested. You can read about the results of phase 1 here. The repurposing of phase 2 for studying Covid-19 is ongoing, with updates to come here. Phase 3 has started and looks promising, but we have paused it to avoid strain on hospital labs during the current pandemic.

    <h2>Key personnel</h2>
    The project is a large collaboration between lots of people, and would not be possible without any one of them. The aims of bugbank have been conceived and pursued by:
    <p><img src="mugshots/David-Wyllie.jpg" align="right" width="46"> David Wyllie is Consultant Microbiologist at Public Health England. Besides his clinical specialism in microbiology, he is an academic at the University of Oxford with expertise in molecular biology, genetics and computing.

    <p><img src="mugshots/Silhouette.png" align="right" width="46">Anne-Marie O'Connell is Head of Information Management at the National Infection Service within PHE. She is the chief architect of PHE's microbiology database, and has worked tirelessly to integrate the diverse daily feeds from English hospitals' microbiology labs into a central resource at PHE headquarters in Colindale, London.

    <p><img src="mugshots/Naomi-Allen.jpg" align="right" width="46">Naomi Allen is Professor of Epidemiology at the University of Oxford and Chief Scientist at UK Biobank. She has been instrumental in the development of the UK Biobank, which is one of the world's largest studies of environmental and genetic risk factors for common diseases, following around half a million people over time for over a decade.

    <p><img src="mewed.jpg" align="right" width="46">Daniel Wilson is Sir Henry Dale Fellow and Big Data Institute Robertson Fellow at the University of Oxford. Within bugbank, he is developing logistical infrastructure for collecting germs from UK Biobank participants and data analysis methods for the joint analysis of human and pathogen genetics to better understand risk factors for infection.
    </ul>

    <h2>Funding</h2>
    Phase 1 was supported by the Public Health England Pipeline Fund. Phases 2 and 3 are funded by the Robertson Foundation. Parallel work developing data analysis methods for phase 3 is funded by the Wellcome Trust and Royal Society.
