		<h2>gammaMap</h2>
		<p>gammaMap is a program for detecting natural selection in sequence data from one or
			more species. It is based on a combined population genetics-phylogenetics model of 
			selection. gammaMap estimates the distribution of selection coefficients, and allows
			localization of the signal of selection using a Bayesian sliding window approach.
			The signature of selection is detected from the contrast in the dN/dS ratio within
			and between species. The method and modelling approach are described in</p>
