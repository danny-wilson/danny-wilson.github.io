<!--		<p><i>For information on Bugbank, a project that aims to integrate infection data into UK Biobank, visit <a href="bugbank.html">this page</a>.</i></p> -->

		<p>I am a Robertson Fellow working in Infectious Diseases and Population Genomics at the 
		<a href="https://www.bdi.ox.ac.uk">Big Data Institute</a>, <a href="https://www.ndph.ox.ac.uk/"
		>Nuffield Department of Population Health</a>, and Director of Studies in Data Science at the 
		Department for Continuing Education, <a href="http://www.ox.ac.uk">University of Oxford</a>.
		My research is supported by the <a href="http://www.wellcome.ac.uk/">Wellcome Trust</a> and 
		<a href="http://www.robertsonfoundation.org/">Robertson Foundation</a>.
		I am a collaborator with the
		<a href="http://www.modmedmicro.ac.uk/">Modernising Medical Microbiology</a>
		consortium based at the John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford, and Associate Member of the 
		<a href="http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/">Department of Statistics</a>.</p>

		<p>My research interests are in the genetic risk of infectious disease and the
		      evolution of pathogen populations, which I study
		      through comparative genome analysis. My research
		      activity focuses on the analysis of bacterial diseases and populations, but I also
		      work on viruses and non-pathogenic microorganisms. Motivating themes in my
		      work are understanding the inheritance of virulence and susceptibility and the effects of
		      transmission, natural selection and recombination in shaping pathogen diversity.
		      I have investigated the evolution of pathogen populations from the
		      colonization of individual hosts and transmission between hosts, through to the
		      whole-species and phylogenetics levels.</p>
