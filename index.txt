		<h2>Welcome to my home page</h2>

<!--		<p><i>For information on Bugbank, a project that aims to integrate infection data into UK Biobank, visit <a href="bugbank.html">this page</a>.</i></p> -->

		<p>I am Professor of Infectious Disease Genomics at the <a href="https://www.ox.ac.uk">University of Oxford</a>.
		I hold a Robertson Fellowship at the 
		<a href="https://www.bdi.ox.ac.uk">Big Data Institute</a>, part of <a href="https://www.ndph.ox.ac.uk/"
		>Oxford Population Health</a>, and serve as Director of Studies in Data Science at the 
		<a href="https://www.conted.ox.ac.uk">Department for Continuing Education</a>.
		My research is supported by the 
		<a href="https://www.robertsonfoundation.org/">Robertson Foundation</a>.
		I am a collaborator with the
		<a href="http://www.modmedmicro.ac.uk/">Modernising Medical Microbiology</a>
		consortium based at the John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford, and Associate Member of the 
		<a href="https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/">Department of Statistics</a>.</p>

		<p>My research interests are in data science, infectious disease and pathogen genomics. I develop new tools for data analysis, and help facilitate infection research through collaborative projects. My research
		      activity has focused on the analysis of bacterial diseases and populations. Motivating themes in my
		      work are understanding genetic and non-genetic risk factors for infection, and the effects of
		      transmission, natural selection and recombination in shaping pathogen diversity.
		      I have investigated the evolution of pathogen populations from the
		      colonization of individual hosts and transmission between hosts, through to the
		      whole-species and phylogenetics levels.</p>
