		<h2>Research</h2>
		<p>I am a Research Associate in the population genetics of infectious disease based 
			at <a href="https://www.lancs.ac.uk/" target="_top">Lancaster University</a>, 
			in the <a href="http://www.maths.lancs.ac.uk/" target="_top">Department of Maths 
				and Statistics</a>. My research is concerned with exploiting the 
			information contained in patterns of DNA sequence variation to learn about the 
			spatial epidemiology of Campylobacter in humans, a common bacterial infection 
			that causes gastroenteritis. I am working with <a href="http://www.maths.lancs.ac.uk/~fearnhea/" target="_top">
				Paul Fearnhead</a>, <a href="http://www.maths.lancs.ac.uk/~robertgo/" target="_top">
				Gareth Roberts</a> and <a href="http://www.maths.lancs.ac.uk/~diggle/" target="_top">
				Peter Diggle</a> in Lancaster, in collaboration with groups at <a href="http://pcwww.liv.ac.uk/vets/research/research.htm" target="_top">
				Liverpool Vet School</a> and <a href="http://www.hpa.org.uk/hpa/contacts/contact_us_regional_labs.htm" target="_top">
				Manchester Royal Infirmary</a>.</p>
		<p>The idea is that genetic variation in pathogen populations contains an (albeit 
			corrupted) record of the evolutionary history of the species. Evolutionary 
			models are applied to DNA sequence data (notably <a href="http://www.mlst.net" target="_top">
				MLST</a> in the case of bacterial pathogens) in order to extract that 
			historical information, which can then be used to inform epidemiological 
			studies. For Campylobacter we are specifically interested in modelling the 
			spatial and temporal epidemiology of cases in the North of England over a 
			period of a decade.</p>

		<h3><a name="selection">omegaMap: Detecting natural selection in genes</a></h3>
		As part of my research into the evolution of the interaction of the immune 
		system with pathogen antibodies, I have developed a new method for detecting 
		natural selection in gene sequences in the presence of recombination. The 
		method uses the codon model of Nielsen and Yang (1998) to estimate variation in 
		the dN/dS ratio (the ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous mutation) along a 
		gene. Previous methods have not allowed for recombination, which occurs 
		frequently not just in genes from bacteria such as <I>Campylobacter</I> and <I>Neisseria 
			meningitidis</I>, but also viruses such as HIV, protozoans such as <I>Plasmodium</I>
		and eukaryotes including humans. When recombination is not accounted for it can 
		elevate the false positive rate for detecting sites under positive 
		selection.</p>
		<p>omegaMap is a program that implements the method, and is freely available from <a href="software.html">
				here</a>. The key publication is</p>

		<h3><a name="meningitis">Meningococcal meningitis</a></h3>
		<p>Previously I was based at the <a href="http://www.medawar.ox.ac.uk/" target="_top">Peter 
				Medawar Building for Pathogen Research</a> in Oxford, where I wrote my 
			D.Phil. thesis on the population genetics of meningococcal meningitis. In 
			Oxford I was a member of the <a href="http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/mathgen" target="_top">
				Mathematical Genetics and Bioinformatics</a> group, and jointly supervised 
			by <a href="http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~mcvean" target="_top">Gil McVean</a> and <a href="http://www.medawar.ox.ac.uk/maiden" target="_top">
				Martin Maiden</a>.</p>
		<p>The title of my <a href="thesis/thesis.html">D.Phil. thesis</a> was 'Multi-locus sequence analysis 
of the 
			pathogen <I>Neisseria meningitidis</I>'. <I>N. meningitidis</I> is the 
			bacterium that causes meningococcal disease (meningitis and septicaemia) in 
			humans at a rate of about 1 case per 20,000 people per year in England (see the <a href="http://www.meningitis.org" target="_top">
				Meningitis Research Foundation</a>). Its asympotmatic carriage rate is 
			higher - around 10% in Europe and the US. Virulence is not thought to be 
			important in the spread and persistence of <I>N. meningitidis</I>, so recent 
			research has concentrated more closely on studying the populations of 
			meningococci carried asymptomatically by one in ten of us.</p>
		<p>Our research showed that contrary to simpler ideas of the evolution of bacterial 
			pathogens, natural selection is an important force in shaping populations of 
			carried meningococci. The heterogeneity of different strains, or clonal 
			complexes, of meningococci, the apparent stability of these clonal complexes 
			over time, and the different characteristics of the clonal complexes (including 
			genetic composition and propensity to cause disease) cannot be explained by 
			neutral models of meningococcal evolution. Some of the key publications I have 
			been involved in are</p>
