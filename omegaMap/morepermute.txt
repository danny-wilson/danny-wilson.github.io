		<h2>More on the permutation test for recombination</h2>
		<p>In the absence of recombination, which is the null hypothesis for the
		permutation test, all sites are linked. That means that adjacent sites
		are as tightly linked to one another as distant sites are to one another.
		Therefore, the null hypothesis predicts that there should be zero
		correlation between physical distance and linkage disequilibrium (LD).</p>

		<p>There are several ways to measure LD. Three commonly-used statistics,
		which are used by <tt>permute</tt>, are r squared [<a href="#refs">1</a>],
		D prime [<a href="#refs">2</a>] and G4 [<a href="#refs">3</a>, <a href="#refs">4</a>]
		(otherwise known as the four-gamete test [<a href="#refs">5</a>]).
		<tt>permute</tt> calculates the correlation coefficient between physical
		distance and LD for all pairs of sites in your gene sequences. It does, however,
		exclude sites that are more than bi-allelic, because the LD statistics are not
		defined.</p>
		
		<img src="ld.bmp" align="right">
		<p> As an example, the figure shows a plot of r squared against physical distance
		(in base pairs) for all pairs of sites in a 480bp housekeeping gene in
		<I>Neisseria meningitidis</I>. The observed correlation coefficient is -0.255,
		indicating that LD decreases as physical distance increases, a pattern consistent
		with intragenic recombination.</p>

		<p>A permutation test is performed to determine whether the observed correlation
		between physical distance and LD is significantly different from zero. For every
		permutation (the default number is 999), the sites are randomly re-ordered
		and the correlation coefficient is re-calculated. If <I>n</I> is the number of
		times, out of the <I>N</I> permutations, that the correlation coefficient was
		as large or larger (in magnitude) than that observed, then the p value is calculated
		as</p>

		<center><p><I>p</I> = (<I>n</I> + 1)/(<I>N</I> + 1)</p></center>

		<p>In the example, <I>p</I> = 0.001. When <I>p</I> < 0.05 then the null hypothesis
		of no recombination can be rejected, meaning that recombination is detectable and
		phylogenetic-based methods should not be applied to your data.</p>

		<p>There is one caveat in this permutation test. Under a second scenario, the
		correlation between physical distance and LD would be expected to be zero if
		recombination is sufficiently frequent that even adjacent sites are effectively
		unlinked. Therefore, if <I>p</I> > 0.05, an alternative explanation to zero
		recombination is that of ultra-high recombination. This does not affect the conclusion
		that if <I>p</I> < 0.05, then there is detectable recombination and you should not
		apply phylogenetic methods to the data.
