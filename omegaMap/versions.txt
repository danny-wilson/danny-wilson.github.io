		<table>
		<tr><th width="20%"> Date <th width="80%"> Files affected
		<tr><th> 1st May 2008 <td> All versions of permute
		<tr><td><td> Uncertain base calling, i.e. use of <tt>R, Y, N</tt> may be interpreted as polymorphism,
			which adds noise to the LD statistics, and reduces the power of the test for recombination.
			To avoid this problem, replace the entire column of the alignment with <tt>N</tt>'s when any sequence
			in that column contains an ambiguous base call.
		<tr><th> 30th May 2007 <td> All versions
		<tr><td><td> Bug when using <tt>independent</tt> model for omega (or rho), with an improper prior,
			and <tt>omegaStart</tt> (or <tt>rhoStart</tt>) is specified using a single value. Avoid this problem
			by specifying <tt>omegaStart</tt> (or <tt>rhoStart</tt>) with a list of values of length <i>L</i>
			codons (or <i>L</i>-1 codons). Thanks to Marcos Perez-Losada for pointing out this problem.
		<tr><th> 19th July 2006 <td> R functions
		<tr><td><td> Fixed a bug in some of the R functions which refused to work when <tt>rho_model = constant</tt>.
			Thanks to JL Campos and Jose Andres for pointing it out.
		<tr><th> 29th June 2006 <td> All versions
		<tr><td><td> <b> Bug when using log normal prior with block models </b>(<tt>omega_model = variable, rho_model
		= variable</tt>). No fix - awaiting new release. Do not use the log normal prior with block models.
		<tr><th> 5th May 2006 <td> Source: omegaMap.cpp. XP: omegaMap.exe
		<tr><td><td> Bug fix affecting the way the <tt>muStart</tt>, etc. options are read from the
			configuration file.
		<tr><th> 19th April 2006 <td> Documentation: documentation.doc, documentation.pdf
		<tr><th><td> When using the <tt>improper_uniform</tt> or <tt>improper_inverse</tt> prior, you
			need to specify the initial value of the parameters using <tt>muStart</tt>, <tt>kappaStart</tt>,
			<tt>omegaStart</tt>, <tt>rhoStart</tt>, and/or <tt>indelStart</tt>.
