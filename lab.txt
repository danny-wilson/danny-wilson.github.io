<h3>Dr Richard Everitt</h3>
<p>Rich is a former Postdoctoral Scientist in the Nuffield Department for Clinical 
Medicine, working on the Modernising Medical Microbiology project funded by UKCRC.
His background is in (mostly Bayesian) statistics and machine learning, which he used
to investigate the evolution of pathogens through the study of full genomic data.</p>

<img id="Bethany Dearlove" align="right" src="https://users.ox.ac.uk/~sjoh1120/files/mugshots/Bethany-Dearlove.jpg">
<h3>Dr Bethany Dearlove</h3>
<p>Bethany is a former DPhil student based in the Nuffield Department of Medicine at the University
of Oxford, supervised by Dr Daniel Wilson and Prof. Peter Donnelly.  Her
work was focussing on the genomic evolution of various pathogens as part of the
Modernising Medical Microbiology Consortium, using new technology to obtain
genetic information in real time.  From this, the aim was to find patterns of
evolution to further understand the spread and transmission of disease,
particularly for three pathogens commonly acquired in hospitals.</p>

<p>She previously studied at the University of Reading, where she completed both her
MSc. in Biometry and BSc. Mathematics and Statistics.  It was here she was
introduced to the concept of Forensic and Genetic Statistics by Dr. Karen
Ayres, inspiring her current research interests.  Bethany's Masters project focused
on a forensic application of statistics, investigating techniques for
familial searching in the UK National DNA Database with missing data and low
copy number DNA profiles.</p>

<p>Whilst in Reading, she competed in synchronised swimming, and has been
nationally ranked in Great Britain for a number of years - her best results
coming in 2009 where she was the British silver medallist in the solo and team
events, and was named the Reading Evening Post Sports Personality of the
Year for Player Loyalty.  In Oxford, she was more likely to be seen
keeping fit by running or cycling, though still to be found on poolside
coaching and choreographing routines.</p>
