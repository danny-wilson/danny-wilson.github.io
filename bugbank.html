		    <h1>Bugbank</h1>
		    <p>Bugbank is a project that aims to link infection data from Public Health England to improve the study of infection in the UK Biobank cohort.</p>
		
		    <h2>News</h2>
		    <iframe src ="https://news.bugbank.uk" width="100%" height="200">

		    <h2>Background</h2>
		    <p>Infection is a major cause of poor health and early death around the 
		world. We are all exposed to infectious microbes, but what is unclear is why some 
		people succumb to infection when others do not? And why some infected people 
		become seriously unwell, when others do not? The Bugbank project is developing 
		infrastructure to help researchers address these questions. 
		
		    <p>Bugbank is a collaboration between the <a href="https://www.bdi.ox.ac.uk">Oxford Big Data Institute</a>, 
		<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/public-health-england">Public 
		Health England</a> (PHE) and <a href="https://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk">UK Biobank</a> (UKB). 
		PHE is responsible for surveillance 
		of infections and antimicrobial resistance in England. UKB is an ongoing study 
		of common diseases in a cohort of 500,000 people aged over 40 when they were 
		recruited in 2006-2010. UKB allows researchers to study the effects of 
		lifestyle, environment and human genetics on disease.
		
		    <p>The objective of Bugbank is to link infection data from PHE to improve 
		the study of infection in the UKB cohort. We have developed a system to 
		dynamically link daily reports of infections in the PHE Microbiology database 
		with the UKB system. This linkage of systems enables the identification of 
		infections that have occurred in UKB participants.
		
		    <p>In addition to data linkage, we are piloting the feasibility of 
		retrieving microbial cultures from UKB participants through clinical diagnostic 
		labs for further microbiological and genetic analysis. This could be used to 
		fulfil the long-term Bugbank objective of performing joint human-microbe 
		studies to better understand the lifestyle, epidemiological and genetic risks 
		for common infections in a large cohort over time. 
		
		    <p>There are three phases to the Bugbank project:
		    <ol>
		    <li>Incorporate infection data from PHE (e.g. microbial species, infection 
		type, antibiotic susceptibility data) into UK Biobank to improve the 
		information available to scientists studying the UKB cohort. This linkage would 
		provide researchers with greater granularity over infection types, improving 
		the chances of finding risk factors for infection.</li>
		
		    <li>Progress from periodic (e.g. annual) linkage of PHE data and UKB, to a 
		dynamic linkage system which incorporates new infection data on a frequent 
		(up to daily) basis. This enables phase 3 and could be repurposed for rapid 
		response to Covid-19 (see below).</li>
		
		    <li>Assess the practicality of identifying and retrieving the microbial 
		cultures from infections occurring within the UKB cohort from clinical 
		diagnostic labs in England for further microbiological and 
		genetic investigation.</li>
		    </ol>
		
		    <p>The computer systems required for phases 1 and 2 have been created and 
		tested. You can read about the results of phase 1 <a href="http://www.danielwilson.me.uk/abstracts/hilton_etal_2020.html">here</a>. The data from phase 1 will become available to UKB researchers pending a PHE-UKB contractual agreement. An article summarising phase 2
		is in preparation. Retrieval and storage of the microbial samples (phase 3) has 
		started and looks promising. 
		
		    <h2>Covid-19</h2>
		    In light of the ongoing pandemic, the systems we have put in place for 
		Bugbank could be deployed to study Covid-19 infection caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 in near-to 
		real time. The linkage of data between PHE and UKB may enable researchers 
		around the world to look for genetic, epidemological and lifestyle risk factors 
		for severe infection. This information could provide invaluable clues as to why 
		some people develop mild symptoms while others develop life-threatening 
		disease. The repurposing of phase 2 for studying Covid-19 is ongoing, with 
		updates to follow here. 
		
		    <h2>Key personnel</h2>
		    The project is a large collaboration between lots of people, and would not 
		be possible without any one of them. The aims of bugbank have been conceived 
		and pursued principally by:
		
		    <h3>David Wyllie</h3><img src="mugshots/David-Wyllie.jpg" align="right" width="46"><p>David 
		is Consultant Microbiologist at Public Health England. Besides his 
		clinical specialism in microbiology, he is an academic at the <a href="https://www.ndm.ox.ac.uk/principal-investigators/researcher/david-wyllie">University of 
		Oxford</a> with expertise in molecular biology, genetics and computing.
		
		    <h3>Anne-Marie O'Connell</h3><img src="mugshots/Silhouette.png" align="right" width="46"><p>Anne-Marie 
		is Head of Information Management at the National Infection Service 
		within PHE. She is the chief architect of PHE's microbiology database, and has 
		worked tirelessly to integrate the diverse daily feeds from English hospitals' 
		microbiology labs into a central resource at PHE headquarters in Colindale, 
		London.
		
		    <h3>Naomi Allen</h3><img src="mugshots/Naomi-Allen.jpg" align="right" width="46"><p>Naomi 
		is Professor of Epidemiology at the <a href="https://www.bdi.ox.ac.uk/Team/naomi-allen">University of Oxford</a>
		 and Chief Scientist at 
		UK Biobank. She has been instrumental in the development of the UK Biobank, 
		which is one of the world's largest studies of environmental and genetic risk 
		factors for common diseases, following around half a million people over time 
		for over a decade.
		
		    <h3>Daniel Wilson</h3><img src="mewed.jpg" align="right" width="46"><p>Daniel is Sir Henry 
		Dale Fellow and Big Data Institute Robertson Fellow at the University of 
		Oxford. Within bugbank, he is developing logistical infrastructure for 
		collecting germs from UK Biobank participants and data analysis methods for the 
		joint analysis of human and pathogen genetics to better understand risk factors 
		for infection.
		    </ul>
		
		    <h2>Funding</h2>
		    Phase 1 was supported by the Public Health England Pipeline Fund. Phases 2 
		and 3 are funded by the <a href="http://www.robertsonfoundation.org">Robertson Foundation</a>. Parallel work developing data 
		analysis methods for phase 3 is funded by the <a href="https://wellcome.ac.uk">Wellcome Trust</a> and <a href="https://royalsociety.org">Royal Society</a>.
