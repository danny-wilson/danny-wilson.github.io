		<h2>Virulogenomics</h2>
		<p><i>Virulogenomics</i> is a Wellcome Trust and Royal Society funded research project to develop
		statistical tools for mapping the genes that influence bacterial phenotypes - notably virulence,
		the severity or frequency of disease.</p>

		<p>Nearly one hundred years of molecular genetics has led to a detailed understanding of important
		bacterial phenotypes, and many genes have been identified as potential virulence factors.
		By some estimates, nearly 5% of genes in some species could be involved in virulence. Popularly,
		a virulence factor is defined as a gene that is necessary for disease. In other words, disabling
		that gene prevents virulence in an experimental model.</p>

		<p>The aim of Virulogenomics is to identify virulence factors using a narrower definition - those
		genes that explain observable variation in virulence in natural populations. This excludes mutations
		induced experimentally that do not exist in natural populations, and therefore cannot explain why
		some bacterial strains cause more disease than others.</p>

		<p>Our starting point for developing tools for phenotype mapping in bacteria are the mature set of
		methods developed for Genome Wide Association Studies (GWAS) in humans. There are several important
		differences in the structure of bacterial populations and bacterial genomes that mean these tools
		cannot necessarily be applied unthinkingly to bacteria. We are developing computational analysis
		pipelines that implement a multifaceted approach to mapping bacterial phenotypes. You can download
		our tools here.</p>
