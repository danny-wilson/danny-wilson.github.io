<p>Rapid and accurate detection of antibiotic resistance in pathogens is an urgent need, affecting 
both patient care and population-scale control. Microbial genome sequencing promises much, 
but many barriers exist to its routine deployment. Here, we address these challenges, using a de 
Bruijn graph comparison of sample and curated knowledge-base, for detection of species and 
minor resistant populations, and resistance-profile prediction. This is implemented in a package, 
Mykrobe predictor, for <i>S. aureus</i> and <i>M. tuberculosis</i>, and runs in under three minutes on a 
laptop from raw data. For <i>S. aureus</i>, we train and validate in 495/471 samples respectively, 
finding error rates comparable to gold-standard phenotypic methods, with sensitivity/specificity 
of 99.3%/99.5% across 12 drugs. For <i>M. tuberculosis</i>, we identify species and predict resistance 
with specificity of 98.5% (training/validating on 1920/1609 samples). Sensitivity of 82.6% is 
limited by current understanding of genetic mechanisms. Finally, we demonstrate feasibility of 
an emerging single-molecule sequencing technique.</p>
