<p>Responsible for the majority of bacterial gastro-enteritis in the developed world, <I>Campylobacter jejuni</I> is a pervasive pathogen of humans and animals, but its evolution is obscure. In this paper we exploit contemporary genetic diversity and empirical evidence to piece together the evolutionary history of <I>C. jejuni</I> and quantify its evolutionary potential. Our combined population genetics-phylogenetics approach reveals a surprising picture. <I>C. jejuni</I> is a rapidly evolving species, subject to intense purifying selection that purges 60% of novel variation, but possessing a massive evolutionary potential. The low mutation rate is offset by a large effective population size, so that a mutation at any site can occur somewhere in the population within the space of a week. Recombination has a fundamental role, generating diversity at twice the rate of <I>de novo</I> mutation, and facilitating gene flow between <I>C. jejuni</I> and its sister species <I>C. coli</I>. We attempt to calibrate the rate of molecular evolution in <I>C. jejuni</I> based solely on within-species variation. The rates we obtain are up to 1,000 times faster than conventional estimates, placing the <I>C. jejuni</I> &#8211; <I>C. coli</I> split at the time of the Neolithic revolution. We weigh the plausibility of such recent bacterial evolution against alternative explanations and discuss the evidence required to settle the issue. </p>
