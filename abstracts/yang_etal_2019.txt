<p><b>Motivation:</b> Resistance co-occurrence within first-line anti-tuberculosis (TB) drugs is a common phenomenon. Existing methods based on genetic data analysis of <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> (MTB) have been able to predict resistance of MTB to individual drugs, but have not considered the resistance co-occurrence and cannot capture the latent structure of poly-resistant TB.</p>
<p><b>Methods:</b> We used a large cohort of TB patients from 16 countries across six continents where whole-genome sequences for each isolate and associated phenotype to anti-TB drugs were obtained using drug susceptibility testing recommended by the World Health Organization. We then proposed an end-to-end multi-task model with stacked denoising auto-encoder (DeepAMR) to learn low-dimensional latent structure and perform multi-label classification.</p>
<p><b>Results:</b> The results showed that the DeepAMR outperformed the examined multi-label learning and conventional single-label learning models with mean sensitivity of 96%, 87%, 73%, and 96% for predicting resistance to rifampicin, ethambutol, pyrazinamide, and multi-drug resistant TB (MDR-TB), respectively, and performed better than single-label learning models with mean sensitivity of 95.6% for isoniazid. In comparison to a method that predicts resistance of an isolate when a single previously identified mutation is present, the DeepAMR improved mean sensitivity for classifying resistance to four first-line drugs and MDR-TB by up to 14%, except for ethambutol. The latent structure obtained by DeepAMR in t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding space illustrated that there were several distinctive subtypes of cross-resistance cases in the latent space.</p>
