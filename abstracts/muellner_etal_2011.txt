<p>Until recently New Zealand had one of the highest rates of human campylobacteriosis
reported by industrialised countries. Since the introduction of a range of control measures in
the poultry production chain a reduction in human cases of around 50% has been observed
nationwide. To inform risk managers a combination of spatial, temporal and molecular
tools - including minimum spanning trees, risk surfaces, rarefaction analysis and dynamic
source attribution modelling - was used in this study to formally evaluate the reduction
in disease risk that occurred after the implementation of control measures in the poultry
industry. Utilizing data from a sentinel surveillance site in the Manawatu region of New
Zealand, our analyses demonstrated a reduction in disease risk attributable to a reduction
in the number of poultry-associated campylobacteriosis cases. Before the implementation
of interventions poultry-associated cases were more prevalent in urban than rural areas,
whereas for ruminant-associated cases the reverse was evident. In addition to the overall
reduction in prevalence, this study also showed stronger effect in urban areas where poultry
sources were more dominant. Overall a combination of molecular and spatial tools has
provided evidence that the interventions aimed at reducing Campylobacter contamination
of poultry were successful in reducing poultry-associated disease and this will inform the
development of future control strategies.</p>
