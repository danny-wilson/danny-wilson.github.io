<p>Infection is important both as a cause of communicable diseases and as an 
exposure predisposing to non-communicable diseases. Investigating disease risk 
is a major research focus in large cohorts like UK Biobank. Linking cohorts to 
electronic health records, like the UK Health Security Agency's Second 
Generation Surveillance System (SGSS), can enhance infection research. SGSS 
collects infection data from &tilde;200 microbiology laboratories across England, 
supporting surveillance, outbreak detection, and antimicrobial resistance 
monitoring.</p>

<p>We previously described algorithms linking SGSS to UK Biobank and 
demonstrated their utility during the COVID-19 pandemic. Here, we assess the 
value of SGSS for infection research by comparing it to Hospital Episode 
Statistics (HES), a centralized clinical dataset on hospital admissions already 
available in UK Biobank. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) were used to 
evaluate the performance of SGSS microbiological diagnoses versus HES 
diagnostic codes for identifying infection outcomes.</p>

<p>SGSS contained substantially more infection records than HES by participant 
(82,888 vs 18,054), particularly for bacteria (excepting Helicobacter pylori 
and Mycobacterium tuberculosis). SGSS yielded more GWAS hits (31 vs 12) 
encompassing more pathogens (12 vs 8). Our findings demonstrate the high 
scientific added-value of SGSS above and beyond that of HES, supporting its 
integration in UK Biobank for future infection research.</p>
