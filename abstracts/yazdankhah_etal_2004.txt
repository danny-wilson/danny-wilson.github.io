<p>The distribution of serogroups and multilocus sequence types (STs) in collections of disease-associated 
and carried meningococci from the period 1991 to 2000 in three European countries (the Czech Republic, 
Greece, and Norway) was investigated. A total of 314 patient isolates and 353 isolates from asymptomatic 
carriers were characterized. The frequency distributions of serogroups and clone complexes differed among 
countries and between disease and carrier isolate collections. Highly significant differentiation was seen 
at each housekeeping locus. A marked positive association of serogroup C with disease was evidenced. The 
ST-11 complex was strongly positively associated with disease; associations for other clone complexes were 
weaker. The genetic diversity of the clone complexes differed. A single ST dominated the ST-11 clone 
complex, while the ST-41/44 complex exhibited greater levels of diversity. These data robustly 
demonstrated differences in the distribution of meningococcal genotypes in disease and carrier isolates 
and among countries. Further, they indicated that differences in genotype diversity and pathogenicity 
exist between meningococcal clone complexes.</p>
