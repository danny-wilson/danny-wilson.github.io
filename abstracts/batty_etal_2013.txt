<p>To date, very large scale sequencing of many clinically important RNA viruses has been complicated
by their high population molecular variation, which creates challenges for polymerase chain reaction
and sequencing primer design. Many RNA viruses are also difficult or currently not possible to
culture, severely limiting the amount and purity of available starting material.
Here, we describe a simple, novel, high-throughput approach to Norovirus and Hepatitis C virus
whole genome sequence determination based on RNA shotgun sequencing (also known as RNA-Seq).
We demonstrate the effectiveness of this method by sequencing three Norovirus samples from
faeces and two Hepatitis C virus samples from blood, on an Illumina MiSeq benchtop sequencer.
More than 97% of reference genomes were recovered. Compared with Sanger sequencing, our method
had no nucleotide differences in 14,019 nucleotides (nt) for Noroviruses (from a total of 2 Norovirus
genomes obtained with Sanger sequencing), and 8 variants in 9,542nt for Hepatitis C virus (1 variant
per 1,193nt). The three Norovirus samples had 2, 3, and 2 distinct positions called as heterozygous,
while the two Hepatitis C virus samples had 117 and 131 positions called as heterozygous. To
confirm that our sample and library preparation could be scaled to true high-throughput, we prepared
and sequenced an additional 77 Norovirus samples in a single batch on an Illumina HiSeq 2000
sequencer, recovering >90% of the reference genome in all but one sample. No discrepancies were
observed across 118,757nt compared between Sanger and our custom RNA-Seq method in 16
samples. By generating viral genomic sequences that are not biased by primer-specific amplification
or enrichment, this method offers the prospect of large-scale, affordable studies of RNA viruses which
could be adapted to routine diagnostic laboratory workflows in the near future, with the potential to
directly characterize within-host viral diversity.</p>
