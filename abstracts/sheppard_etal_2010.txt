<p>The common zoonotic pathogen <i>Campylobacter coli</i> is an important cause of bacterial gastroenteritis worldwide but its
evolution is incompletely understood. Using multilocus sequence type (MLST) data of 7 housekeeping genes from a
national survey of <i>Campylobacter</i> in Scotland (2005/6), and a combined population genetic-phylogenetics approach, we
investigated the evolutionary history of <i>C. coli</i>. Genealogical reconstruction of isolates from clinical infection, farm animals
and the environment, revealed a three-clade genetic structure. The majority of farm animal, and all disease causing
genotypes belonged to a single clade (clade 1) which had comparatively low synonymous sequence diversity, little deep
branching genetic structure, and a higher number of shared alleles providing evidence of recent clonal decent. Calibration
of the rate of molecular evolution, based on within-species genetic variation, estimated a more rapid rate of evolution than
in traditional estimates. This placed the divergence of the clades at less than 2500 years ago, consistent with the
introduction of an agricultural niche having had an effect upon the evolution of the <i>C. coli</i> clades. Attribution of clinical
isolate genotypes to source, using an asymmetric island model, confirmed that strains from chicken and ruminants, and not
pigs or turkeys, are the principal source of human <i>C. coli</i> infection. Taken together these analyses are consistent with an
evolutionary scenario describing the emergence of agriculture-associated <i>C. coli</i> lineage that is an important human
pathogen.</p>
