<p>The availability of large genome datasets has changed the microbiology 
research landscape. Analysing such data requires computationally demanding 
analyses and new approaches have come from different data analysis 
philosophies. Machine learning and statistical inference have overlapping 
knowledge discovery aims and approaches. However, machine learning focuses on 
optimizing prediction, whereas statistical inference focuses on understanding 
the processes relating variables. In this review, we outline the different 
aspirations, precepts, and resulting methodologies, with examples from 
microbial genomics. Emphasizing complementarity, we argue that the combination 
and synthesis of machine learning and statistics has potential for pathogen 
research in the big data era.</p>
