<p>A novel class of methods for combining <i>p</i>-values to perform aggregate hypothesis 
tests has emerged that exploit the properties of heavy-tailed Stable 
distributions. These methods offer important practical advantages including 
robustness to dependence and better-than-Bonferroni scaleability, and they 
reveal theoretical connections between Bayesian and classical hypothesis tests. 
The harmonic mean <i>p</i>-value (HMP) procedure is based on the convergence of summed 
inverse <i>p</i>-values to the Landau distribution, while the Cauchy combination test 
(CCT) is based on the self-similarity of summed Cauchy-transformed <i>p</i>-values. 
The CCT has the advantage that it is analytic and exact. The HMP has the 
advantage that it emulates a model-averaged Bayes factor, is insensitive to 
<i>p</i>-values near 1, and offers multilevel testing via a closed testing procedure. 
Here I investigate whether other Stable combination tests can combine these 
benefits, and identify a new method, the L&eacute;vy combination test (LCT). The LCT 
exploits the self-similarity of sums of L&eacute;vy random variables transformed from 
<i>p</i>-values. Under arbitrary dependence, the LCT possesses better robustness than 
the CCT and HMP, with two-fold worst-case inflation at small significance 
thresholds. It controls the strong-sense familywise error rate through a 
multilevel test uniformly more powerful than Bonferroni. Simulations show that 
the LCT behaves like Simes' test in some respects, with power intermediate 
between the HMP and Bonferroni. The LCT represents an interesting and 
attractive addition to combined testing methods based on heavy-tailed 
distributions.</p>
