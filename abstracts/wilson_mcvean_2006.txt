<p>Models of molecular evolution that incorporate the ratio of 
nonsynonymous to synonymous polymorphism 
(<i>d<sub>N</sub>/d<sub>S</sub></i> 
ratio) as a parameter can 
be used to identify sites that are under diversifying selection or 
functional constraint in a sample of gene sequences. However, when there 
has been recombination in the evolutionary history of the sequences, 
reconstructing a single phylogenetic tree is not appropriate, and 
inference based on a single tree can give misleading results. In the 
presence of high levels of recombination, the identification of sites 
experiencing diversifying selection can suffer from a false-positive rate 
as high as 90%. We present a model that uses a population genetics 
approximation to the coalescent with recombination and use reversible-jump 
MCMC to perform Bayesian inference on both the 
<i>d<sub>N</sub>/d<sub>S</sub></i> 
ratio and the 
recombination rate, allowing each to vary along the sequence. We 
demonstrate that the method has the power to detect variation in the 
<i>d<sub>N</sub>/d<sub>S</sub></i> 
ratio and the recombination rate and does not suffer from a high 
false-positive rate. We use the method to analyze the <i>porB</i> gene of 
<i>Neisseria meningitidis</i> and verify the inferences using prior 
sensitivity 
analysis and model criticism techniques.</p>
