<p><b>Background.</b>  <i>Neisseria meningitidis</i> is a diverse commensal bacterium that occasionally 
causes severe 
invasive disease. The relationship between meningococcal genotype and capsular polysaccharide, the 
principal virulence factor and vaccine component, was investigated in carried meningococci isolated from 
8000 children and young adults in Bavaria, Germany.</p>

<p><b>Methods.</b>  Of the 830 meningococci isolated (carriage rate, 10.4%) by microbiological techniques, 
822 were 
characterized by serogrouping, multilocus sequence typing, and genetic analysis of the capsule region. 
Statistical and population genetic analyses were applied to these data.</p>

<p><b>Results.</b>  The rapid increase in carriage rates with age of carrier, the low prevalence of 
hyperinvasive 
meningococci, and the relative prevalence of the 4 disease-associated serogroups were consistent with 
earlier observations. There was no genetic structuring of the meningococcal population by age of carrier 
or sampling location; however, there was significant geographic structuring of the meningococci isolated 
in civil, but not military, institutions. The rate of capsule gene expression did not vary with age of 
carrier or meningococcal genotype, except for serogroup C, for which increased expression was associated 
with ST-11 (formerly ET-37) complex meningococci.</p>
