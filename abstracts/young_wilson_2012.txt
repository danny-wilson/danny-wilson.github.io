<p>In a recent paper appearing in the <i>Proceedingsof the National Academy of Sciences of theUnited States of America</i>, Young and colleaguesreport the case of a persistent carrierof <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> who went onto develop a virulent bloodstream infection(Young et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 2012).By sequencing the genomes of bacteria sampledfrom the nose and bloodstream overan extended period, they pieced togetherthe evolutionary changes that accompaniedthe transition from asymptomatic carriage toinvasive disease. Among an unusual clusterof knockout mutations that coincided withthe beginning of a period of declining healthin the patient, they identified the truncationof an <i>AraC</i> family transcriptional regulator asa likely modifier of virulence, demonstratingthat genetic changes that occur in bacterialgenomes during prolonged carriage couldplay a role in pathogenesis. Here we discussthe alternative evolutionary hypotheses forthe observed excess of knockout mutationsand review the evidence in favor of a causalrole for regulatory gene dysfunction in bacterialvirulence. We consider the prospects forsystematic studies into the evolution of virulencein bacterial carriage populations.</p>
