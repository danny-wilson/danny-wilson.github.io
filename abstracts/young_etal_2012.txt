<p>Whole genome sequencing offers new insights into the evolution of bacterial
pathogens and the etiology of bacterial disease. <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> is a major
cause of bacteria-associated mortality and invasive disease, and is carried
asymptomatically by 27% of adults. 80% of bacteremias match the carried strain.
However, the role of evolutionary change in the pathogen during the progression
from carriage to disease is incompletely understood. Here we use high-throughput
genome sequencing to discover the genetic changes that accompany the transition
from nasal carriage to fatal bloodstream infection in an individual colonized with
methicillin-sensitive <i>S. aureus</i> (MSSA). We found a single, cohesive population
exhibiting a repertoire of 30 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and four
insertion/deletion (indel) variants. Mutations accumulated at a steady rate over a 13
month period, except for a cluster of mutations preceding the transition to disease.
Although bloodstream bacteria differed by just eight mutations from the original
nasally carried bacteria, half of those mutations caused truncation of proteins,
including a premature stop codon in an AraC-family transcriptional regulator that
has been implicated in pathogenicity. Comparison to evolution in two asymptomatic
carriers supported the conclusion that clusters of protein-truncating mutations are
highly unusual. Our results demonstrate that bacterial diversity in vivo is limited
but nonetheless detectable by whole genome sequencing, enabling the study of
evolutionary dynamics within the host. Regulatory or structural changes that occur
during carriage may be functionally important for pathogenesis, so identifying those
changes is a crucial step in understanding the biological causes of invasive bacterial
disease.</p>
