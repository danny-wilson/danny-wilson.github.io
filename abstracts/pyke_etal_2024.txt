<p>Ross River virus (RRV) and Barmah Forest virus (BFV) are arthritogenic arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses) 
    that exhibit generalist host associations and share distributions in Australia and Papua New Guinea (PNG). 
    Using stochastic mapping and discrete-trait phylogenetic analyses, we profiled the independent evolution of RRV and 
    BFV signature mutations. Analysis of 186 RRV and 88 BFV genomes demonstrated their viral evolution trajectories have 
    involved repeated selection of mutations, particularly in the nonstructural protein 1 (nsP1) and envelope 3 (E3) genes 
    suggesting convergent evolution. Convergent mutations in the nsP1 genes of RRV (residues 248 and 441) and BFV (residues 
    297 and 447) may be involved with catalytic enzyme mechanisms and host membrane interactions during viral RNA replication 
    and capping. Convergent E3 mutations (RRV site 59 and BFV site 57) may be associated with enzymatic furin activity and 
    cleavage of E3 from protein precursors assisting viral maturation and infectivity. Given their requirement to replicate 
    in disparate insect and vertebrate hosts, convergent evolution in RRV and BFV may represent a dynamic link between their 
    requirement to selectively ‘fine-tune’ intracellular host interactions and viral replicative enzymatic processes. Despite 
    evidence of evolutionary convergence, selection pressure analyses did not reveal any RRV or BFV amino acid sites under 
    strong positive selection and only weak positive selection for nonstructural protein sites. These findings may indicate 
    that their alphavirus ancestors were subject to positive selection events which predisposed ongoing pervasive convergent 
    evolution, and this largely supports continued purifying selection in RRV and BFV populations during their replication in 
    mosquito and vertebrate hosts.</p>
