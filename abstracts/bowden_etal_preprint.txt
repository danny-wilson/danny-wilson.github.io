<p>Unlike in human genomics, where sequencing of hundreds of genomes is still prohibitively expensive for most researchers, whole-genome sequencing of bacteria has recently emerged as a cost-effective and convenient approach for many problems in microbiology.  Genomic sequencing by next-generation methods can be used at small scales as a routine laboratory tool, for example to check the integrity of an experimental strain.  Applied at large scales, it provides the ultimate resolution for studying population structure, uncovering the origins of outbreaks and identifying specific transmission events, and provides a basis for unraveling the relationships between phenotype and genotype. The massive capacity of next-generation sequencing also has the potential to transform the study of complex heterogeneous samples such as environmental and clinical samples.  Next-generation sequencing is revolutionizing microbiology research and will soon be applied to (routine) clinical microbiology practice, where it could replace many complex techniques with a single basic workflow that could also enhance the testing of clinical samples.</p>
