<p>The World Health Organization has a goal of universal drug susceptibility testing for patients with tuberculosis. However, molecular diagnostics to date have focused largely on first-line drugs and predicting susceptibilities in a binary manner (classifying strains as either susceptible or resistant). Here, we used a multivariable linear mixed model alongside whole genome sequencing and a quantitative microtiter plate assay to relate genomic mutations to minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) in 15,211 <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> clinical isolates from 23 countries across five continents. We identified 492 unique MIC-elevating variants across 13 drugs, as well as 91 mutations likely linked to hypersensitivity. Our results advance genetics-based diagnostics for tuberculosis and serve as a curated training/testing dataset for development of drug resistance prediction algorithms.</p>
