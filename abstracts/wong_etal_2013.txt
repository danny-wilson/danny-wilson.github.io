<h4>Background</h4>
<p>Norovirus is the commonest cause of epidemic gastroenteritis among people of all ages.
   Outbreaks frequently occur in hospitals and the community, costing the UK an estimated
   [pound sign]110 m per annum. An evolutionary explanation for periodic increases in
   norovirus cases, despite some host-specific post immunity is currently limited to
   the identification of obvious recombinants. Our understanding could be significantly
   enhanced by full length genome sequences for large numbers of intensively sampled
   viruses, which would also assist control and vaccine design. Our objective is to develop
   rapid, high-throughput, end-to-end methods yielding complete norovirus genome sequences.
   We apply these methods to recent English outbreaks, placing them in the wider context
   of the international norovirus epidemic of winter 2012.
</p>
<h4>Method</h4>
<p>Norovirus sequences were generated from 28 unique clinical samples by Illumina RNA
   sequencing (RNA-Seq) of total faecal RNA. A range of de novo sequence assemblers were
   attempted. The best assembler was identified by validation against three replicate
   samples and two norovirus qPCR negative samples, together with an additional 20 sequences
   determined by PCR and fractional capillary sequencing. Phylogenetic methods were used
   to reconstruct evolutionary relationships from the whole genome sequences.
</p>
<h4>Results</h4>
<p>Full length norovirus genomes were generated from 23/28 samples. 5/28 partial norovirus
   genomes were associated with low viral copy numbers. The de novo assembled sequences
   differed from sequences determined by capillary sequencing by &lt;0.003%. Intra-host
   nucleotide sequence diversity was rare, but detectable by mapping short sequence reads
   onto its de novo assembled consensus. Genomes similar to the Sydney 2012 strain caused
   78% (18/23) of cases, consistent with its previously documented association with the
   winter 2012 global outbreak. Interestingly, phylogenetic analysis and recombination
   detection analysis of the consensus sequences identified two related viruses as recombinants,
   containing sequences in prior circulation to Sydney 2012 in open reading frame (ORF)
   2.
</p>
<h4>Conclusion</h4>
<p>Our approach facilitates the rapid determination of complete norovirus genomes. This
   method provides high resolution of full norovirus genomes which, when coupled with
   detailed epidemiology, may improve the understanding of evolution and control of this
   important healthcare-associated pathogen.
