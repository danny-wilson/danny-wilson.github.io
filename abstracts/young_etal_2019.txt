<p>Pyomyositis is a severe bacterial infection of skeletal muscle, commonly affecting children in tropical regions and predominantly caused by <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>. To understand the contribution of bacterial genomic factors to pyomyositis, we conducted a genome-wide association study of <i>S. aureus</i> cultured from 101 children with pyomyositis and 417 children with asymptomatic nasal carriage attending the Angkor Hospital for Children in Cambodia. We found a strong relationship between bacterial genetic variation and pyomyositis, with estimated heritability 63.8% (95% CI 49.2-78.4%). The presence of the Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL) locus increased the odds of pyomyositis 130-fold (p=10-17.9). The signal of association mapped both to the PVL-coding sequence and the sequence immediately upstream. Together these regions explained >99.9% of heritability. Our results establish staphylococcal pyomyositis, like tetanus and diphtheria, as critically dependent on expression of a single toxin and demonstrate the potential for association studies to identify specific bacterial genes promoting severe human disease.</p>
