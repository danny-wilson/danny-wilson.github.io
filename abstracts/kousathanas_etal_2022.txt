<p>Critical Covid-19 is caused by immune-mediated inflammatory lung injury. Host genetic variation influences the development of illness requiring critical care or hospitalisation following SARS-CoV-2 infection. The GenOMICC (Genetics of Mortality in Critical Care) study enables the comparison of genomes from critically-ill cases with population controls in order to find underlying disease mechanisms. Here, we use whole genome sequencing in 7,491 critically-ill cases compared with 48,400 controls to discover and replicate 23 independent variants that significantly predispose to critical Covid-19. We identify 16 new independent associations, including variants within genes involved in interferon signalling (<i>IL10RB</i>, <i>PLSCR1</i>), leucocyte differentiation (<i>BCL11A</i>), and blood type antigen secretor status (<i>FUT2</i>). Using transcriptome-wide association and colocalisation to infer the effect of gene expression on disease severity, we find evidence implicating multiple genes, including reduced expression of a membrane flippase (<i>ATP11A</i>), and increased mucin expression (<i>MUC1</i>), in critical disease. Mendelian randomisation provides evidence in support of causal roles for myeloid cell adhesion molecules (<i>SELE</i>, <i>ICAM5</i>, <i>CD209</i>) and coagulation factor <i>F8</i>, all of which are potentially druggable targets. Our results are broadly consistent with a multi-component model of Covid-19 pathophysiology, in which at least two distinct mechanisms can predispose to life-threatening disease: failure to control viral replication, or an enhanced tendency towards pulmonary inflammation and intravascular coagulation. We show that comparison between critically-ill cases and population controls is highly efficient for detection of therapeutically-relevant mechanisms of disease.</p>
