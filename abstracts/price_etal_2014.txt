<p><b>Background</b>. Strategies to prevent <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> infection in hospitals focus on patient-to-patient transmission. We used whole-genome sequencing to investigate the role of colonized patients as the source of new <i>S. aureus</i> acquisitions, and the reliability of identifying patient-to-patient transmission using the conventional approach of spa typing and overlapping patient stay.</p>

<p><b>Methods</b>. Over 14 months, all unselected patients admitted to an adult intensive care unit (ICU) were serially screened for <i>S. aureus</i>. All available isolates (n = 275) were spa typed and underwent whole-genome sequencing to investigate their relatedness at high resolution.</p>

<p><b>Results</b>. <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> was carried by 185 of 1109 patients sampled within 24 hours of ICU admission (16.7%); 59 (5.3%) patients carried methicillin-resistant <i>S. aureus</i> (MRSA). Forty-four <i>S. aureus</i> (22 MRSA) acquisitions while on ICU were detected. Isolates were available for genetic analysis from 37 acquisitions. Whole-genome sequencing indicated that 7 of these 37 (18.9%) were transmissions from other colonized patients. Conventional methods (spa typing combined with overlapping patient stay) falsely identified 3 patient-to-patient transmissions (all MRSA) and failed to detect 2 acquisitions and 4 transmissions (2 MRSA).</p>

<p><b>Conclusions</b>. Only a minority of <i>S. aureus</i> acquisitions can be explained by patient-to-patient transmission. Whole-genome sequencing provides the resolution to disprove transmission events indicated by conventional methods and also to reveal otherwise unsuspected transmission events. Whole-genome sequencing should replace conventional methods for detection of nosocomial <i>S. aureus</i> transmission.</p>
