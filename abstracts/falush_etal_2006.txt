<p>In bacteria, DNA sequence mismatches act as a barrier to recombination 
between distantly related organisms and can potentially promote the 
cohesion of species. We have performed computer simulations which show 
that the homology dependence of recombination can cause <i>de novo</i> 
speciation 
in a neutrally evolving population once a critical population size has 
been exceeded. Our model can explain the patterns of divergence and 
genetic exchange observed in the genus <i>Salmonella</i>, without invoking 
either 
natural selection or geographical population subdivision. If this model 
was validated, based on extensive sequence data, it would imply that the 
named subspecies of <i>Salmonella</i> enterica correspond to good 
biological 
species, making species boundaries objective. However, multilocus sequence 
typing data, analysed using several conventional tools, provide a 
misleading impression of relationships within <i>S. enterica</i> 
subspecies 
enterica and do not provide the resolution to establish whether new 
species are presently being formed.</p>
