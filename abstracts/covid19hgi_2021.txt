<p>The genetic makeup of an individual contributes to susceptibility and 
response to viral infection. While environmental, clinical and social factors 
play a role in exposure to SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 disease severity, host 
genetics may also be important. Identifying host-specific genetic factors may 
reveal biological mechanisms of therapeutic relevance and clarify causal 
relationships of modifiable environmental risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection 
and outcomes. We formed a global network of researchers to investigate the role 
of human genetics in SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 severity. We describe 
the results of three genome-wide association meta-analyses comprised of up to 
49,562 COVID-19 patients from 46 studies across 19 countries. We reported 13 
genome-wide significant loci that are associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection or 
severe manifestations of COVID-19. Several of these loci correspond to 
previously documented associations to lung or autoimmune and inflammatory 
diseases. They also represent potentially actionable mechanisms in 
response to infection. Mendelian Randomization analyses support a causal role 
for smoking and body mass index for severe COVID-19 although not for type II 
diabetes. The identification of novel host genetic factors associated with 
COVID-19, with unprecedented speed, was made possible by the community of human 
genetic researchers coming together to prioritize sharing of data, results, 
resources and analytical frameworks. This working model of international 
collaboration underscores what is possible for future genetic discoveries in 
emerging pandemics, or indeed for any complex human disease.</p>
