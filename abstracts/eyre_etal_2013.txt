<p>Bacterial whole genome sequencing offers the prospect of rapid and high
precision investigation of infectious disease outbreaks. Close genetic
relationships between microorganisms isolated from different infected cases
suggest transmission is a strong possibility, whereas transmission between cases
with genetically distinct bacterial isolates can be excluded. However, undetected
mixed infections-infection with two or more unrelated strains of the same species where
only one is sequenced-potentially impairs exclusion of transmission with
certainty, and may therefore limit the utility of this technique. We investigated
the problem by developing a computationally efficient method for detecting
mixed infection without the need for resource-intensive independent sequencing
of multiple bacterial colonies. Given the relatively low density of single
nucleotide polymorphisms within bacterial sequence data direct reconstruction
of mixed infection haplotypes from current short-read sequence data is not
consistently possible. We therefore use a two-step maximum likelihood-
based approach, assuming each sample contains up to two infecting strains.
We jointly estimate the proportion of the infection arising from the dominant
and minor strains, and the sequence divergence between these strains. In
cases where mixed infection is confirmed, the dominant and minor haplotypes
are then matched to a database of previously sequenced local isolates. We
demonstrate the performance of our algorithm with <i>in silico</i> and <i>in vitro</i> mixed
infection experiments, and apply it to transmission of an important healthcare-
associated pathogen, <i>Clostridium difficile</i>. Using hospital ward movement data in
a previously described stochastic transmission model, 15 pairs of cases enriched
for likely transmission events associated with mixed infection were selected. Our
method identified four previously undetected mixed infections, and a previously
undetected transmission event, but no direct transmission between the pairs of
cases under investigation. These results demonstrate that mixed infections can
be detected without additional sequencing effort, and this will be important in
assessing the extent of cryptic transmission in our hospitals.</p>
