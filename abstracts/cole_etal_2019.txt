<p>Members of the genus <i>Staphylococcus</i> have been isolated from humans, animals, and the environment. Accurate identification using whole-genome sequencing requires access to data derived from type strains. We provide sequence data for type strains of all species in the genus, which at the time of writing have standing in nomenclature.
