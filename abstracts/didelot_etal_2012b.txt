<p><b>Background</b><br>
The control of <i>Clostridium difficile</i> infection (CDI) is a major international healthcare
priority, hindered by a limited understanding of transmission epidemiology for these
bacteria. However, transmission studies of bacterial pathogens are rapidly being
transformed by the advent of next generation sequencing.</p>

<p><b>Results</b><br>
Here we sequence whole <i>C. difficile</i> genomes from 486 CDI cases arising over 4
years in Oxfordshire. We show that we can estimate the times back to common
ancestors of bacterial lineages with sufficient resolution to distinguish whether direct
transmission is plausible or not. Time depths were inferred using a within-host
evolutionary rate that we estimated at 2.3 mutations per genome per year based on
serially isolated genomes (with 95% credibility interval 1.6-3.0). The subset of
plausible transmissions was found to be highly associated with pairs of patients
sharing time and space in hospital. Conversely, the majority (81%) of pairs of
genomes matched by conventional typing and isolated from patients within a month
of each other were too distantly related to be direct transmissions.</p>

<p><b>Conclusions</b><br>
Our results confirm that nosocomial transmission between symptomatic CDI cases
contributes far less to current rates of CDI acquisition than has been widely assumed,
which clarifies the importance of future research into other transmission routes, for
example from asymptomatic carriers. With the costs of DNA sequencing rapidly
falling and its use becoming more and more widespread, genomics will revolutionize
our understanding of the transmission of bacterial pathogens.</p>
