<p>Background. The <i>Staphylococcus capitis</i> NRCS-A strain has emerged as a global cause of late-onset sepsis associated with outbreaks in neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) whose transmission is incompletely understood.

<p>Methods. Demographic and clinical data for 45 neonates with <i>S. capitis</i> and 90 with other coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) isolated from sterile sites were reviewed, and clinical significance was determined. <i>S. capitis</i> isolated from 27 neonates at 2 hospitals between 2017 and 2022 underwent long-read (ONT) (n=27) and short-read (Illumina) sequencing (n=18). These sequences were compared with <i>S. capitis</i> sequenced from blood culture isolates from other adult and paediatric patients in the same hospitals (n=6), S. capitis isolated from surface swabs (found in 5/150 samples), rectal swabs (in 2/69 samples) in NICU patients and NICU environmental samples (in 5/114 samples). Reads from all samples were mapped to a hybrid assembly of a local sterile site strain, forming a complete UK NRCS-A reference genome, for outbreak analysis and comparison with 826 other <i>S. capitis</i> from the UK and Germany.
    
<p>Results. <i>S. capitis</i> bacteraemia was associated with increased length of NICU stay at sampling (median day 22 vs day 12 for other CoNS isolated; P=0.05). A phylogeny of sequenced <i>S. capitis</i> revealed a cluster comprised of 25/27 neonatal sterile site isolates and 3/5 superficial, 2/2 rectal and 1/5 environmental isolates. No isolates from other wards belonged to this cluster. Phylogenetic comparison with published sequences confirmed that the cluster was NRCS-A outbreak strain but found a relatively high genomic diversity (mean pairwise distance of 84.9 SNPs) and an estimated NRCS-A <i>S. capitis</i> molecular clock of 5.1 SNPs/genome/year (95% credibility interval 4.3–5.9). The presence of <i>S. capitis</i> in superficial cultures did not correlate with neonatal bacteraemia, but both neonates with rectal NRCS-A <i>S. capitis</i> carriage identified also experienced <i>S. capitis</i> bacteraemia.
    
<p>Conclusions. <i>S. capitis</i> bacteraemia occurred in patients with longer NICU admission than other CoNS. Genomic analysis confirms clinically significant infections with the NRCS-A <i>S. capitis</i> strain, distinct from non-NICU clinical samples. Multiple introductions of <i>S. capitis</i>, rather than prolonged environmental persistence, were seen over 5 years of infections.
