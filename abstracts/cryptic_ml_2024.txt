<p>There remains a clinical need for better approaches to rapid drug susceptibility testing in view of the increasing burden of multidrug 
    resistant tuberculosis. Binary susceptibility phenotypes only capture changes in minimum inhibitory concentration when these cross the 
    critical concentration, even though other changes may be clinically relevant. We developed a machine learning system to predict minimum 
    inhibitory concentration from unassembled whole-genome sequencing data for 13 anti-tuberculosis drugs. We trained, validated and tested 
    the system on 10,859 isolates from the CRyPTIC dataset. Essential agreement rates (predicted MIC within one doubling dilution of observed 
    MIC) were above 92% for first-line drugs, 91% for fluoroquinolones and aminoglycosides, and 90% for new and repurposed drugs, albeit with 
    a significant drop in performance for the very few phenotypically resistant isolates in the latter group. To further validate the model 
    in the absence of external MIC datasets, we predicted MIC and converted values to binary for an external set of 15,239 isolates with 
    binary phenotypes, and compare their performance against a previously validated mutation catalogue, the expected performance of existing 
    molecular assays, and World Health Organization Target Product Profiles. The sensitivity of the model on the external dataset was greater 
    than 90% for all drugs except ethionamide, clofazimine and linezolid. Specificity was greater than 95% for all drugs except ethambutol, 
    ethionamide, bedaquiline, delamanid and clofazimine. The proposed system can provide quantitative susceptibility phenotyping to help guide 
    antimicrobial therapy, although further data collection and validation are required before machine learning can be used clinically for all 
    drugs.</p>
