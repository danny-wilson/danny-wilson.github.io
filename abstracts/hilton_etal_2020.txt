<p><b>Background</b>: Our understanding of the genetic and environmental risk 
factors for serious bacterial infectious disease in ageing populations remains 
incomplete. Utilising the UK Biobank (UKB), a prospective cohort study of 
500,000 men and women aged 40-69 years at recruitment (2006-2010), could help 
address this.</p>

<p><b>Objectives</b>: To assess the feasibility of linking an England-wide 
dataset of microbiological isolations to UK Biobank participants, and to 
characterise microbial isolation from UK Biobank participants.</p>

<p><b>Methods</b>: 
Positive microbiological isolations from patients in England, as recorded in 
the Public Health England Second Generation Surveillance System (SGSS), were 
linked to UK Biobank participants using pseudonymised identifiers.</p>

<p><b>Results</b>: By 
January 2015, the ascertainment of laboratory reports from UK Biobank 
participants by SGSS was estimated at 98%. 4.5% of English UK Biobank 
participants had a positive microbiological isolate in 2015; Escherichia coli, 
other Enterobacteriaceae and Staphylococcus aureus were the most common 
isolates. Half the UKB isolates were obtained from 12 microbiology 
laboratories, and 70% from 21 laboratories. Incidence rate ratios for microbial isolation, which is indicative of serious infection, from the UK Biobank cohort 
relative to the comparably aged general population ranged from 0.6 to 1 for 
different organisms, compatible with the previously described healthy 
participant bias in UKB. </p>

<p><b>Conclusions</b>: Data on microbial isolations can be 
linked to UKB participants from January 2015 onwards. This linked data would 
offer new opportunities for research into infectious disease in older 
individuals.
