<p><b>Background</b> <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> is a major bacterial pathogen in humans, and a dominant cause of severe bloodstream infections. Globally, antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in <i>S. aureus</i> remains challenging. While human risk factors for infection have been defined, contradictory evidence exists for the role of bacterial genomic variation in <i>S. aureus</i> disease.</p>

<p><b>Methods</b> To investigate the contribution of bacterial lineage and genomic variation to the development of bloodstream infection, we undertook a genome-wide association study comparing bacteria from 1017 individuals with bacteraemia to 984 adults with asymptomatic <i>S. aureus</i> nasal carriage. Within 984 carriage isolates, we also compared healthcare-associated (HA) carriage with community-associated (CA) carriage.</p>

<p><b>Results</b> All major global lineages were represented in both bacteraemia and carriage, with no evidence for different attack rates. However, kmers tagging trimethoprim resistance-conferring mutation F99Y in dfrB were significantly associated with bacteraemia-vs-carriage (p=10<sup>-8.9</sup>-10<sup>-9.3</sup>). Pooling variation within genes, bacteraemia-vs-carriage was associated with the presence of mecA (HMP=10<sup>-5.3</sup>) as well as the presence of SCCmec (HMP=10<sup>-4.4</sup>).</p>

<p>Among <i>S. aureus</i> carriers, no lineages were associated with HA-vs-CA carriage. However, we found a novel signal of HA-vs-CA carriage in the foldase protein prsA, where kmers representing conserved sequence allele were associated with CA carriage (p=10<sup>-7.1</sup>-10<sup>-19.4</sup>), while in gyrA, a ciprofloxacin resistance-conferring mutation, L84S, was associated with HA carriage (p=10<sup>-7.2</sup>).</p>

<p><b>Conclusions</b> In an extensive study of <i>S. aureus</i> bacteraemia and nasal carriage in the UK, we found strong evidence that all <i>S. aureus</i> lineages are equally capable of causing bloodstream infection, and of being carried in the healthcare environment.</p>

<p>Genomic variation in the foldase protein prsA is a novel genomic marker of healthcare origin in <i>S. aureus</i> but was not associated with bacteraemia. AMR determinants were associated with both bacteraemia and hospital-associated carriage, suggesting that AMR increases the propensity not only to survive in hospital environments, but also to cause invasive disease.</p>
