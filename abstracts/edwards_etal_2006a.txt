<p><b>Background</b>
Genetic diversity of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) population within an individual is 
lost during transmission to a new host. The demography of transmission is an important determinant of 
evolutionary dynamics, particularly the relative impact of natural selection and genetic drift immediately 
following HIV-1 infection. Despite this, the magnitude of this population bottleneck is unclear.</p>

<p><b>Results</b>
We use coalescent methods to quantify the bottleneck in a single case of homosexual transmission and find 
that over 99% of the <i>env</i> and <i>gag</i> diversity present in the donor is lost. This was consistent 
with the 
diversity present at seroconversion in nine other horizontally infected individuals. Furthermore, we 
estimated viral diversity at birth in 27 infants infected through vertical transmission and found there to 
be no difference between the two modes of transmission.</p>

<p><b>Conclusion</b>
Assuming the bottleneck at transmission is selectively neutral, such a severe reduction in genetic 
diversity has important implications for adaptation in HIV-1, since beneficial mutations have a reduced 
chance of transmission.</p>
