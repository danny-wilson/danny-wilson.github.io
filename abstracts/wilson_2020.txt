<p>The test statistics underpinning several methods for combining <i>p</i>-values are special cases 
of generalized mean <i>p</i>-value (GMP), including the minimum (Bonferroni procedure), harmonic mean 
and geometric mean. A key assumption influencing the practical performance of such methods 
concerns the dependence between <i>p</i>-values. Approaches that do not require specific knowledge 
of the dependence structure are practically convenient. Vovk and Wang derived significance 
thresholds for GMPs under the worst-case scenario of arbitrary dependence using results from 
Robust Risk Analysis (RRA).
Here I calculate significance thresholds and closed testing procedures using Generalized 
Central Limit Theorem (GCLT). GCLT formally assumes independence, but enjoys a degree of 
robustness to dependence. The GCLT thresholds are less stringent than RRA thresholds, with the 
disparity increasing as the exponent of the GMP <nobr>(<i>r</i>)</nobr> increases. I motivate a model of <i>p</i>-value 
dependence based on a Wishart-Multivariate-Gamma distribution for the underlying log-likelihood 
ratios. In simulations under this model, the RRA thresholds produced tests that were usually 
less powerful than Bonferroni, while the GCLT thresholds produced tests more powerful than 
Bonferroni, for all <nobr><i>r</i> > -&infin;</nobr>. Above <nobr><i>r</i> > -1/2</nobr>,  standard central limit theorem applied and the 
GCLT thresholds no longer possessed any useful robustness to dependence.
I consider the implications of these results in the context of various interpretations of GMPs, 
and conclude that the GCLT-based harmonic mean <i>p</i>-value procedure and Simes' (1986) test 
represent good compromises in power-robustness trade-off for combining dependent tests.
