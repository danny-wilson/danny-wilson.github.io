<p>Through an analysis of polymorphism within and divergence between species, we can
hope to learn about the distribution of selective effects of mutations in the genome,
changes in the fitness landscape that occur over time, and the location of sites
involved in key adaptations that distinguish modern day species. We introduce a novel
method for the analysis of variation in selection pressures within and between species,
spatially along the genome and temporally between lineages. We model codon
evolution explicitly using a joint population genetics-phylogenetics approach that we
developed for the construction of multiallelic models with mutation, selection and drift.
Our approach has the advantage of performing direct inference on coding sequences,
inferring ancestral states probabilistically, utilizing allele frequency information, and
generalizing to multiple species. We use a Bayesian sliding window model for
intragenic variation in selection coefficients that efficiently combines information across
sites and captures spatial clustering within the genome. To demonstrate the utility of
the method, we infer selective pressures acting in <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> and <i>D.
simulans</i> from polymorphism and divergence data for 100 X-linked coding regions.</p>
