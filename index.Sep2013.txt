		<h2>Welcome to my home page</h2>
		<p>Here you will find details of my <a href="research.html#top">research interests</a>,
			<a href="publications.html">publications</a>, <a href="cv.html">CV</a> and how
			to <a href="contact.html">contact me</a>. I am a research Fellow in Genomics at the
			<a href="http://www.ndm.ox.ac.uk/home">Nuffield Department
			of Medicine</a> in Oxford. Based at the John Radcliffe Hospital, and the
			Wellcome Trust Centre for Human Genetics, I am a participant in the UKCRC
			Consortium <a href="http://www.modmedmicro.ac.uk/">Modernising Medical
			Microbiology</a>, a project that aims to harness next-generation sequencing
			technologies to track and trace clinically important human pathogens.
			I am also a Principal Investigator at the interdisciplinary
			Oxford Martin School <a href="http://www.oxfordmartin.ox.ac.uk/institutes/emerging_infections">
			Institute for Emerging Infections</a>.</p>

		<p>My research interests are in the evolution of natural pathogen populations, which I understand
		      through comparative analysis of genomes within and between species. My research
		      activity focuses on the analysis of bacterial pathogen populations, but I also
		      work on viruses and non-pathogenic species. Motivating themes in my
		      work are understanding how transmission, natural selection and recombination shape the diversity of natural populations,
		      and detecting their signature in the genome. Using genomics and disease
		      phenotyping, I am investigating the evolution of bacterial pathogens from the
		      colonization of individual hosts and transmission between hosts, through to the
		      whole-species and phylogenetics levels.</p>
