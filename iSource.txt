		<p>iSource is a program for source attribution (population assignment) using multi-locus
		   genotypes with linkage disequilibrium. iSource can be used to assign
		   sequences of unknown origin to putative source populations based on DNA sequence similarity to 
		   a panel of reference sequences of known source. It was specifically designed with
		   multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) in mind, but can be applied more widely.

		<p>Source attribution probabilities are calculated using a statistical model of the way the
		   DNA sequences evolve over time. In the model, there are parameters representing the
		   processes of mutation, DNA exchange (recombination) and migration between populations. In
		   the case of infectious disease, migration might correspond to transmission between host
		   populations. These processes lead to differences in gene frequencies between populations,
		   facilitating source attribution. The model is trained by estimating the evolutionary
		   parameters exclusively from sequences of known source, before using it to calculate source
		   attribution probabilities for sequences of unknown origin.

		<p>iSource differs fundamentally to similar population genetic analyses, notably 
		   <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/group/pritchardlab/structure.html">Structure</a>, in that it approximates
		   a specific genetical model known as the migration matrix model, a generalization of Wright's
		   symmetric island model. By modelling linkage disequilibrium between loci in the source
		   populations, and by estimating the relative contribution of each putatitive source population
		   to the sequences of unknown origin, iSource improves its accuracy of source attribution. This
		   sensitivity is particularly important in weakly differentiated populations.
