		<h2>Welcome to my home page</h2>
		<p>Here you will find details of my <a href="research.html#top">research interests</a>,
			<a href="publications.html">publications</a>, <a href="cv.html">CV</a> and how
			to <a href="contact.html">contact me</a>. As of January, I have taken up the
			position of Leadership Fellow in Genomic Medicine at the Nuffield Department
			of Medicine in Oxford. Based at the Oxford Centre for Gene Function, and the
			Wellcome Trust Centre for Human Genetics, I am a participant in the UKCRC
			Consortium <a href="http://www.modmedmicro.ac.uk/">Modernising Medical
			Microbiology</a>, a project that aims to harness next-generation sequencing
			technologies to track and trace clinically important human pathogens.</p>

		<p>My research interests centre on the application of population genetics tools to solving
			problems in human infectious diseases. Another major interest of mine is detecting the
			signature of natural selection within populations. My software omegaMap is
			designed to address that problem in recombining populations, and is available
			to download from this site.</p>

		<p>Until December I was a Post-doctoral Research Scholar in Molly Przeworski's lab at
			the University of Chicago Department of Human Genetics. In Chicago I focused on
			detecting the signal of natural selection in the coding genome, in particular
			identifying the sites of adaptive evolution and inferring the distribution of
			selective effects using novel population genetics methods. We are in the process 
			of applying these analyses to coding regions in humans and Drosophila.
			Prior to my appointment at the University of Chicago, I was a Research Associate
			at Lancaster University, where I worked with Paul Fearnhead and Peter Diggle
			on the epidemiology of human cases of Campylobacter, the primary cause of
			bacterial food poisoning. I completed my doctorate in the population genetics
			of meningococcal meningitis at the Peter Medawar Building for Pathogen Research
			in Oxford, where I was supervised by Gil McVean and Martin Maiden.</p>
