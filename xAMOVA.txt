		<h2>xAMOVA</h2>

		<p>xAMOVA is a program that extends the AMOVA (analysis of molecular variance, Excoffier et al 1992) to crossed designs where there are two factors (i.e. a two-way AMOVA). Components of variance are estimated for each factor, and simulation-based significance tests are performed for each factor individually and the model as a whole.</p>
