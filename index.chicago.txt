		<h2>Welcome to my home page</h2>
		<p>I have included details of my <a href="research.html#top">research interests</a>,
			<a href="publications.html">publications</a>, <a href="cv.html">CV</a> and how
			to <a href="contact.html">contact me</a>. As of January, I have taken up the
			position of Leadership Fellow in Genomic Medicine at the Nuffield Department
			of Medicine in Oxford. Until December I was a Post-doctoral Research Scholar
			in Molly Przeworski's lab at the University of Chicago Department of Human Genetics.</p>
		<p>My research interests centre on the application of population genetics tools to solving
			problems in human infectious diseases. Another major interest of mine is detecting the
			signature of natural selection within populations. My software omegaMap is
			designed to address that problem in recombining populations, and is available
			to download from this site.</p>

		<p>Prior to my appointment at the University of Chicago, I was a Research Associate
			at Lancaster University, where I worked with Paul Fearnhead and Peter Diggle
			on the epidemiology of human cases of Campylobacter, the primary cause of
			bacterial food poisoning. I completed my doctorate in the population genetics
			of meningococcal meningitis at the Peter Medawar Building for Pathogen Research
			in Oxford, where I was supervised by Gil McVean and Martin Maiden.</p>

		<h3>Estimating diversifying selection and functional constraint in the presence of 
			recombination</h3>
		<p><a href="software.html">omegaMap</a> is a method for estimating variation in the 
			dN/dS ratio within a gene in the presence of recombination. Click
