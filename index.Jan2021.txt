		<p>I am a <a href="http://www.wellcome.ac.uk/">Wellcome Trust</a> and <a href="http://royalsociety.org/">Royal Society</a>
		     	funded Sir Henry Dale Fellow working in Infectious Disease Genomics at the
			<a href="https://www.bdi.ox.ac.uk">Big Data Institute</a>, <a href="https://www.ndph.ox.ac.uk/">Nuffield Department of Population Health</a>, <a href="http://www.ox.ac.uk">University of Oxford</a>.
			I am supported by the <a href="http://www.robertsonfoundation.org/">Robertson Foundation</a>
			and I am a collaborator with the
			<a href="http://www.modmedmicro.ac.uk/">Modernising Medical Microbiology</a>
			consortium based at the John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford. 
			I am also involved in the interdisciplinary
			Oxford Martin School <a href="http://www.oxfordmartin.ox.ac.uk/institutes/emerging_infections">
			Institute for Emerging Infections</a> and Associate Member of the <a href="http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/">Department of Statistics</a>.</p>

		<p>My research interests are in the evolution of natural pathogen populations, which I study
		      through comparative analysis of genomes within and between species. My research
		      activity focuses on the analysis of bacterial pathogen populations, but I also
		      work on viruses and non-pathogenic species. Motivating themes in my
		      work are understanding the inheritance of virulence and the effects of
		      transmission, natural selection and recombination in shaping pathogen diversity.
		      I am investigating the evolution of pathogen populations from the
		      colonization of individual hosts and transmission between hosts, through to the
		      whole-species and phylogenetics levels.</p>
